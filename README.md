Complete PHP API for Jenkins. An easy solution designed to interact with Jenkins CI API.

**Disclaimer:** I know that there are many other Jenkins PHP libraries like this one but my goal by creating this repository is not to create a competition or something like that. I totally respect the work of other developpers and I saluate their realisation. I just want to create my personnal library and I expose it to you if you want to use it :). Stay cool!

## Installation (with Composer)

1. Install the package by typing this in your project directory:
    ```
    composer require utarwyn/jenkins-php-api
    ```

2. Include the file **vendor/autoload.php** in your application.

3. Follow the guide [*here*](https://github.com/utarwyn/jenkins-php-api/wiki/Getting-started) to get started.
