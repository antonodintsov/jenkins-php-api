\
Complete PHP API for Jenkins. An easy solution designed to interact with Jenkins CI API.

**Disclaimer:** I know that there are many other Jenkins PHP libraries like this one but my goal by creating this repository is not to create a competition or something like that. I totally respect the work of other developpers and I saluate their realisation. I just want to create my personnal library and I expose it to you if you want to use it :). Stay cool!

You need at least **PHP 7.1+** to use this tool!
